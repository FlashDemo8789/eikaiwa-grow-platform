## 🎯 Closing Script Options

### For Interested Prospects
"I can see this solving your [specific pain point mentioned]. Let's schedule a custom setup session where we'll configure this specifically for [School Name]. When works better - this week or next?"

### For Hesitant Prospects  
"I understand this seems comprehensive. How about we start with just the photo sharing feature? You'll see parent engagement improve immediately, then we can add the other features."

### For Price-Sensitive Schools
"Think of this as insurance for your student retention. Losing just two students per month costs more than this entire system. Plus, the automated payment reminders alone save hours of staff time."
